## Introduction

**Genres:** Action, Adventure, Roguelite

This is the idea for a video game product I have been keeping in my mind for a quite long time. The main story of this game relating to a veteran of the Tay Son army after defeat of the Battle of Thi Nai, he is resurrected and kept safe in a small cottage within a small village at the west bank of Hau River. His main mission is to comeback to meet his parents, who is still living in Gia Dinh city where is now a great stronghold of his former enemies. Moreover, he has to deal with ghouls, hostile animals, bandits and the royal armies of Nguyen Lord on his way to Gia Dinh.

The gameplay for this game will be simillar to Hades, The Legend of Zelda with typical RPG dialogue system with branching options and endings. It will be a 3D game, the arts style can be hand-painted or cartoonic, with the influence of the southern Vietnamese environment. The camera view will be presented in isometric like Hades and RPG games.

I will soon provide the GDD as well as some illustration of it.

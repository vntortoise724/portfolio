## How this works ⚙️

- **Step 1:** Open your Unity and create a 3D project
- **Step 2:** Clone this repository and drag all componets in Assets folder into your project
- **Step 3:** Open CubeEvade Scene in Scenes folder and you can run the game

_# This is a prototype, therefore it doesn't have a build version._

# How to play 🎮

- **Basic Control:** Press A to move the 🍆 to the left and D to move to the right
- **Mechanisms:** When being hit by 🔴 or unable to catch 🟨, you will lose HP. Therefore, you must catch the 🟨 and dodge the 🔴
- **Additional Features:** Intense sound effect, therefore:
  - Use a headphone before playing 🎧
  - Remove Audio in the Sound list of the AudioManager in Hierachy tab in the left of the Unity Engine window 🛠️
  - Mute if you prefer not wanting to playing it in a crowded area 🔇

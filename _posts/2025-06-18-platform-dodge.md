## Introduction 

My second casual 3D game. In this game, you must dodge red balls and not let them drag you out of the platforms.

## How this works ⚙️

- **Step 1:** Open your Unity and create a 3D project
- **Step 2:** Clone this repository and drag all componets in Assets folder into your project
- **Step 3:** Open PlatformDodge Scene in Scenes folder and you can run the game

_# This is a prototype, therefore it doesn't have a build version._

## The layout 🗺️
There will be **one main platform** (blue) and **4 sub-platforms** (green). The sub-platforms will elevate up and down. 

## How to play 🎮

- **Basic Control:** Press **W, A, S, D** to move the player **up, left, down, right**.
- **Mechanisms:** 
  - When being hit by 🔴, you will be pouched backward and 🔴 will continue chasing your character until it successfully drags you out of the platforms.

  - During the gameplay, you will see a floating 🟨, that is a **power up**. When your player consumes it, the player's speed will be boosted for some second.

  - Once you successfully "trick" the ball to let it fall off the platforms, new phase will be triggered. Each time you get through a phase, a 🔴 and a 🟨 will be added to the main platform.

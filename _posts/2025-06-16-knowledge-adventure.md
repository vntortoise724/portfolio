## Introduction 📖

The prototype contains two scenes for House and School. It is developed using **Unity** and the graphic is made using **Asesprite** (for pixel art and animation) and **Photoshop** (for UI elements, illustration and dialogue character poitrait).

## How to play 🎮
The game has the quite simple control:
- Hold **A - D** to move the character **left - right**
- Click **E** to interact with objects and NPCs 
- When dialogue is triggered, you can use **A - D** then **Enter** to choose and select your desire dialogue options, or use **mouse cursor** to click on them.
- For trivia quizzes, they have the same control like dialogue, and you can also press **W - S** then **Enter** to select the **above - below** answer.
- For minigame, the prototype only have one which is slide puzzle game. To slide a puzzle, **left-click** on the piece next to the empty tile and that piece will switch its place with the empty tile.
